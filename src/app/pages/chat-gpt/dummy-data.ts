Sure, here's a sample code for installing a PWA app in your Ionic project:

1. First, you need to add the PWA package to your project:

'''
npm install @angular/pwa --save
'''

2. Next, you need to import the 'ServiceWorkerModule' in your 'app.module.ts' file:

'''
import { ServiceWorkerModule } from '@angular/service-worker';
import { environment } from '../environments/environment';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
// your app components
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    IonicModule.forRoot(),
    AppRoutingModule,
    ServiceWorkerModule.register('ngsw-worker.js', { enabled: environment.production })
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
'''

3. In your 'index.html' file, add the following meta tags to enable PWA features:

'''
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff">
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json">
'''

4. Create a 'manifest.json' file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

'''
{
  "name": "My PWA App",
  "short_name": "My App",
  "theme_color": "#ffffff",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "display": "standalone",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "assets/icon/icon.png","sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "assets/icon/icon-512x512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
'''
5. Finally, build your app for production and deploy it to a web server. Your app should now be installable as a PWA on supported devices.

Note: Make sure to test your PWA app on different devices and browsers to ensure that it works as expected. Also, keep in mind that not all browsers and devices support PWA features, so it's important to provide a fallback experience for users who cannot install or use your app as a PWA.

Here's an example of how you can prompt the user to install your PWA app:

'''
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { SwUpdate } from '@angular/service-worker';
import { Platform } from '@ionic/angular';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['app.component.scss']
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(private swUpdate: SwUpdate, private platform: Platform) {
    this.initializeApp();
  }

  initializeApp() {
    this.platform.ready().then(() => {
      if (this.swUpdate.isEnabled) {
        this.swUpdate.available.subscribe(() => {
          if (confirm('New version available. Load New Version?')) {
		window.location.reload();
          }
        });
      }

      if (window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches) {
        console.log('App is running as a PWA');
      } else {
        console.log('App is not running as a PWA');
      }
    });
  }
}
'''

In this example, we're using the 'SwUpdate' service to check for updates to our PWA app. If an update is available, we prompt the user to reload the app with the new version. We're also checking if the app is running as a PWA using the 'Platform' service and logging the result to the console.

I hope this helps you get started with installing a PWA app in your Ionic project! Let me know if you have any further questions.
